    <h1>4.1.4 Pair-Programming Reflection</h1>
    <p>1. 1. Pair-programming is basically where two programmers work together to write programs. </p>
    <p>2. The role of the driver is to write the code using their keyboard and mouse.</p>
    <p>3. The role of the navigator is to find bugs/erros in the code the driver writes and fixes them accordingly.</p>
    <p>4. One benefit of pair-programming is the fact that there is a really good chance that there will no bugs in the code.</p>
    <p>5. Some challenges that I expect to arise during pair-programming is the fact that the two programmers may not get along well. And another challenge is that sometimes it is really hard to work together. Lastly, it is 15% slower to code as a pair rather than coding solo.</p>
